-- Note: This creates sample articles without user profiles since auth users need to be created through the auth system

-- Sample articles with placeholder author IDs (these will be updated when real users sign up)

-- Note: Since we can't create auth users directly, we'll skip the seed data for now
-- Users can sign up through the app and create their own content
-- This file is kept for reference and can be used later when we have real users
